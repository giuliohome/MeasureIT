Classical Time in C#, blogged [here](https://giuliohome.wordpress.com/2017/07/09/classical-c-versus-pure-f/).

This is the traditional, classical C# version of [Pure times in F#](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/07/04/pure-times-in-f/).

It is not a detailed, literal translation, but only a proof of concept.
